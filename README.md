# Toygrad
A simple MLP neural net implemented from scratch.

### How to run it?
One can use any virtual env manager, all requirements are frozen in
`requirements.txt`. For example using Python built-in venv:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After that you can run `experiment.ipynb` notebook to interact with the network:

```bash
python -m jupyterlab
```
